# IFC.JSON Viewer

## What is it?
This viewer is part of an open source project that works on IFC files represented in JSON syntax: IFC.JSON files. The viewer is an open-source web-based viewer, relying on Javascript. It allows loading IFC.JSON files and viewing them (3D building models and semantics). Furthermore, data can be queried and subsets can be created for information exchanges in JSON format. This is done by filtering using JSONPath text filters (https://jsonpath.com/).

Sample IFC.JSON files are provided in the [sample_files directory](sample_files). These files are obtained using the Trimble Sketchup exporter by Jan Brouwer (BIMTools): https://github.com/BIM-Tools/Sketchup-ifcJSON-export.
